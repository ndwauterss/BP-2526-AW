  abstract    = {Recently, serverless computing has gained recognition as a leading cloud computing method. Providing a solution that does not require direct server and infrastructure management, this technology has addressed many traditional model problems by eliminating them. Therefore, operational complexity and costs are reduced, allowing developers to concentrate on writing and deploying software without worrying about server management. This chapter examines the advantages, disadvantages, and applications of serverless computing, implementation environments, and reasons for its use. Additionally, integrating this computing paradigm with other technologies is examined to address the challenges of managing, securing, and implementing large amounts of data. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive view of the potentials and limitations of serverless computing by comparing its applications in different industries and examining the future trends of this technology. Lastly, this chapter provides a comprehensive conclusion of the applications and challenges of serverless computing.},

  abstract    = {At Halmstad University a project was developed to provide recommendations forupgrading and downgrading the cloud resource app service plan based on the customersusage over the last 30 days. In todays day and age, cloud resources and services are oftenquite expensive and offers a variety of different plans which can make it overwhelmingfor the customer to easily choose which tier they need for their plan. The result of thisscript indicate that the cloud users should consider changing subscription tier based onhow the historical data of their usage of the plan has looked like during the last 30 days.The proposed algorithm suggests an upgrade of a tier if the plan is overutilized andsuggest a downgrade of a tier if the plan is underutilized. The developed PowerShell codeuses the First-Fit and the Rule-based algorithmic approach from the related workresearched in the paper. The result found was that the code was able to give suitablerecommendations to scale up and down tiers for plans which were under and overutilizedbased on the percentual utilization rules set up and Legacy DEV SKU mapping. Theresults obtained showed that the suggested plan can reduce costs by up to 30\% and giveroughly 438.2\% more performance per \$USD spent.},
